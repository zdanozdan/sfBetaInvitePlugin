Prerequisites
-------------

sfPostMarkPlugin for sending confirmation and invitation emails. If this plugin is not installed mail is sent using sfMailer


Installation
------------

1 - Install the plugin.

The easiest way to install `sfBetaInvitePlugin` is to use the symfony command line:

    > php symfony plugin:install sfBetaInvitePlugin

However recommended method is to fork the latest package from my git hub [https://github.com/zdanozdan/sfBetaInvitePlugin] as I put changes there and may not have time to build symfony package.

     > git clone  git@github.com:zdanozdan/sfBetaInvitePlugin.git

2 - Install and configure sfPostMarkPlugin using plugin:install or better clone from github. Skip this step when using sfSwiftMailer. Use instructions from [https://github.com/zdanozdan/sfPostMarkPlugin]

3 - Register on postmarkapp, create server, get api key and signatures

  >  sf_postmark_plugin:
  >    key:                  API Key > should get it from postmark after registration
  >    from:                 foo@bar.com > your regisered mail address
  >    name:                 Foo Bar > your registered name

4 - Clear the cache to enable the autoloading to find the new classes:

> php symfony cc

5 - New routes has been added

Call this route to get invitation form:

  >http://localhost/invite/when/lauched/inviteNew -> '@sf_beta_invite_plugin_invite_new'

When params are correct (sfEmailValidator called) other route is called:

  >http://localhost/invite/when/lauched/inviteCreate -> '@sf_beta_invite_plugin_invite_create'

6. Customize

Look at the templates, you can customize the way form is displayed by adding your own template.
